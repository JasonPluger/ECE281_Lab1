### Analysis
Using the idea of 2's complement binary conversion, I created a truth table with inputs
A, B, and C that took on all possible 3-digit binary values. I then created outputs X, 
Y, and Z that took on the 2's complement values of the inputs. I created Karnaugh maps 
from the truth table that were then used to form the minimum value SOP and POS equations.
These equations were then used to create the circuit schematics found in my lab notebook.
Xilinx was then used to simulate the circuit and an ouput waveform was acquired from the
simulation. After analyzing the waveform and comparing it to my truth table, I found that
they matched exactly. That is, with each input combination of A, B, and C, the output
of X, Y, and Z yielded what I originally expected and had predicted in my truth table.
